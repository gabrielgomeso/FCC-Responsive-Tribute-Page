            <h2>This is why Fitzgerald is great:</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                <strong>Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald </strong>(September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940) was an American
                novelist, essayist, screenwriter, and short-story writer, although he was best known for his novels
                depicting the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age—a term which he coined. During his lifetime, he
                published four novels, four collections of short stories, and 164 short stories. Although he temporarily
                achieved popular success and fortune in the 1920s, Fitzgerald only received wide critical and popular
                acclaim after his death. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th
                century.
                <br><br>
                <strong>In the 1920s</strong>, Fitzgerald frequented Europe, where he was influenced by the modernist
                writers and artists of the "Lost Generation" expatriate community, particularly Ernest Hemingway. His
                second novel, The Beautiful and Damned (1922), propelled him into the New York City elite. To maintain
                his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, The Great
                Gatsby (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed
                reviews, The Great Gatsby is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the "Great American Novel".
                While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her schizophrenia, Fitzgerald completed his final
                novel, Tender Is the Night (1934).
                <br><br>
                <strong>Faced with financial difficulties</strong> due to the declining popularity of his works,
                Fitzgerald turned to Hollywood, writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism,
                he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Last Tycoon (1941), was completed by
                Edmund Wilson and published after Fitzgerald's death.

            <h2>Fitzgerald quotes:</h2>
            <hr>
            <p><em>"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one...just remember that all the people in this world haven't
                    had the advantages that you've had."</em>
                <br><br>
                <em> "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."</em>
                <br><br>
                <em> "I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little
                    fool."</em>
                <br><br>
                <em> "Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of
                    the few
                    honest people that I have ever known."</em>
